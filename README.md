# Winshield_Wiper_Timer
Using existing windshield wiper circuitry, I want to design an embedded system with an ARM processor and minimal peripherals that will adjust the existing timing of the wiper blades. The new timing will be controlled with a single push button, when pressed the system will start recording the time until the button is pressed again. The blades will then operate at that interval until cancelled.
